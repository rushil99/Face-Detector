# Face-Detector
Rushil Mistry 

This is a simple Face Detector that uses open cv to find faces in an image and video.
Even though the data set that is used is already trained you can provide it with different 
face images and train the model. This is a really simple program that can be really powerful once 
different things are added to it.
